Setup
	Install libraries
		https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python
		https://github.com/pimoroni/pms5003-python

Service
I've wrapped the bash as a systemd service: aerprotek.ems
	from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/426862/proper-way-to-run-shell-script-as-a-daemon

# edit bin/aerprotek.ems so that the /path/to/ems.py matches where you've put it
#
# change the output file target for your needs.
#
# cp bin/aerprotek.ems /usr/bin/aerprotek.ems
# 
# cp bin/ems.service /etc/systemd/system/
# 
# systemctl start ems.service
# systemctl enable ems.service

this should provide for automatic system level monitoring & restart.
